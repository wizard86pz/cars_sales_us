# ETL process fot Vehicle Sales Data

This project starts from a dataset containing information about vehicle sales in the United States. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data) and contains information about 558,837 used cars listed for sale.

It encompasses details such as the year (model year), make, model, trim (vehicle setup/optionals), body type, transmission type, VIN, state of registration, condition rating, odometer reading, exterior and interior colors, seller information, MMR (Manheim Market Report) values, selling prices, sale dates.

We will start by loading the dataset and performing some basic data cleaning and exploration. After that, we will analyze the data to answer some questions and extract insights.

The project is condensed in one single Jupyter Notebook file (ETL_cars.ipynb).
